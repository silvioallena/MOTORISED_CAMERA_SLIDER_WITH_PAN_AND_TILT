# MOTORISED_CAMERA_SLIDER_WITH_PAN_AND_TILT


Thank you to Issac Chasteau and Christoph Lehner for their amazing creations.
This project start from their design and intuitions and my intent was to get the
simplest possible motorised camera slider with pan and tilt features.
Controlled directly via Bluetooth with the help of a Playstation3 or Playstation4 gamepad
and an ESP32 microcontroller.

I tried to follow as much as possible two simple directives: 

- Simplicity of construction and operation
- Use of as few components as possible (Less cost possible)

All coupled with a detailed step-by-step video tutorial in multiple parts.
Especially because no one ever did it !!!

The main structural components that support the filming device need to be 3D printed.
Sorry!


-----------------------VERY IMPORTANT-----------------------------------------------

The libraries and program implemented inside the microcontroller ask for an
ORIGINAL Sony gamepad. 
New or used dosen't matter.
Only 3% to 5% of the "non original" gamepads on any markeplace has compatible
hardware with the libraries.
The developers relied on original Sony hardware for their libraries.
Please don't waste your money.
